        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p> 
                Accessibility carries with it financial benefits, It has many social benefits, the public relation benefits can help grow a company or institution, it avoids potential legal issues and, optimizes search engine results and, BTW, it is the morally correct choice. According to the CDC one in five americans has trouble hearing and one in ten have trouble with vision. This alone accounts for 58 million americans. Having a site that is that leaves out 20% of potential clients carries with it financial repercussions. (Emma Grant)

                The social benefits can reap both ethical and  financial rewards. Building an accessible website can also help your reputation.  Why not stand out from your competition by being accessible to everyone and demonstrating social responsibility.(Stephanie Stiles)  A strong reputation can go a long ways toward your bottom line.
            </p>

                Legally speaking, it is better to make sure your site lives up to at least the ADA. “Retail giant Target was sued over accessibility, opting to settle the matter out of court, it is only a matter of time before more commercial website owners could find themselves in a similar situation.” (Emma Grant) You may also want to consider not losing out on all of the government work or work for educational institutions. They both have standards for accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having an accessible page means that people with disabilities can use your site.  “More specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others, including older people with changing abilities due to aging” (W3C) The reality is that when your site is not accessible it means that some people can not use it and that is simply not fair.
