        <h2>SOCIAL MEDIA OPTIMIZATION (SMO)</h2>
            <p>
            Up front I have to admit that I know very little about social media. So I turned to the only expert I know on the subject, my 16 year old daughter, and yes she concurs that I am a little too old for social media. That said , let's explore what I learned.
            </p>
            <p>
            Social Media Optimization (SMO) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) go hand in hand. “Social media optimization is becoming an increasingly important factor in search engine optimization, which is the process of designing a website in a way so that it has as high a ranking as possible on search engines.” (Wikipedia) The more “likes” you have or mentions in any of the Social Media sites like Reddit, Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram and Google+, etc. the higher ranking you can achieve in search engine results. “Further, SMO is helpful to target particular geographic regions in order to target and reach potential customers.” (Wikipedia)
            </p>
            <p>
            It used to be that the amount of links associated with your website got you good rankings in the search engine results. Google deployed their Hummingbird algorithm in 2013 and that changed the way search engine results appear. “In the last month or so, Google quietly launched a major overhaul of their search algorithm. Dubbed Hummingbird because of its speed and precision, the new algorithm changes the way Google interprets search terms—and changes the weight of some factors that drive search rankings.” ( Wishpond - guest post) This new way of ranking web  pages based on social media makes SMO a key factor in driving clients or potential clients to you website
            </p>
            <p>
            There are some practical steps one can take to build reputation and increase returns. The quality counts, “Your success depends upon word of mouth. The thousands of customers to whom you have served will contact other thousands of their contacts and will recommend you. In this way, your sales cycle will keep on revolving.” (Jyti Agrawal, et al.) Have patience and grow your presence, gaining brand loyalty takes time and significant persistence and can be achieved one step at a time. Practice the law of reciprocity, “According to this phenomenon, share and upload content created by others too on your profile if you want and expect others to do the same with your posts as well.” (Jyti Agrawal, et al.)
            </p>
            <p>
            Above all listen more and talk less, know your customer. This brings me back to the opening, maybe I am not too old and maybe she will not be in the demographic the websites I develop will be targeting. “If you wish to succeed on your social media platforms, then follow the conversation and responses of your target audience.” (Jyti Agrawal, et al.) Someday I may understand what goes through a 16 year olds head, but for now, I just like listening to her.
