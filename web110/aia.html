                        <h2>Other Artists</h2> 
                        <p>Younger male and female artists. Less traditional, a litte experimental and unorthodox. Some would be manga artists others graphic novel artists but all would produce or enjoy the expression a drawing or painting can offer. All would be fairly tech savvy, enjoying their phones and tablets. most would not use a desk top computer on a regular basis. All would take their art seriously, and my experience shows, could be hyper critical and also the most supporting people you have ever met.  </p>

                        <li> Keeping them interested in coming back</li>
                        <li> What input from end user would help???</li>
                        <li> How can I make a little money from this project</li>
                        <li> Social networking</li>

                        <li> A very good responsive site, focused on the mobile experience..</li>
                        <li> When it comes to attention span I am thinking flashing lights, or the web site equivelent, for this site, lots of high quality drawings, focusing on a variety of techniques.</li>
                        <li> I think a good "sugestion box" of sorts would work</li>
                        <li> Ads would be interesting to look at, I do not know how that works.</li>
                        <li> social networking would be something I need to do more reasearch to see how other site approach this topic</li>

                        <h2>Hipsters</h2>
                        <p> Again, almost the same description as above the difference is they are not artists, just people who appreciate art. Still the younger set, believe they are hip. know all the cool places to be. Trendy, with style and fasion.   </p>
                    </td>

                        <li> Timely, not sure what he ment, need to have more conversations with my my client. </li>

                        <h2>Courious people</h2>
                        <p> This could be anybody, my client wants to have a small story line that unfolds over time and it involves a catoon bedbug. It is funny, so people looking for some different humor. People looking for good quality drawing. I think the age would be younger but I am thinking less than 50. Still they would be tech savvy, mostly phones for start, maybe on breaks or busses. </p>

                        <li> Keeping quality high</li>
                        <li> keeping material  accessible </li>

                        <li> Have a well organized layout</li>
                        <li> Make sure scans of work are good, sizing pictures correctly. </li>
                        <li> I think by accessible we are talking about not offending everone. He should offend some buut don't  cut your nose off to spite your face. </li>
